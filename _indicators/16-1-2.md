rationale_interpretation: 'From  Goal  16  TST  Working  Group,  OHCHR:    These  indicators  refer  to  two  forms  of  violent  deaths  (intentional  homicide  and  conflict-related  deaths).  Intentional  homicides  occur  in  all  countries  of  the  world  and  have  global  applicability,  while  conflict-related  deaths  occur  in  countries  afflicted  by  wars.    The  rates  of  intentional  homicide  and  conflict-related  deaths  should  be  kept  separate,  as  combining  them  into  one  single  indicator  would  risk  collating  two  distinct  phenomena  and  unequal  sources  of  data.  In  particular,  the  quality  of  data  on  conflictrelated  deaths  is  inevitably  affected  by  the  difficulties  of  producing  accurate  statistics  in  situations  of  armed  conflict.    Monitoring  intentional  homicides  is  necessary  to  better  assess  their  causes  and  consequences  and,  in  the  longer  term,  to  develop  effective  prevention  measures.  It  is  based  on  statistical  data  routinely  produced  by  law  enforcement  authorities  and/or  public  health  institutions,  with  a  high  degree  of  international  comparability.    Conflict-related  deaths  measure  the  direct  impact  of  conflicts  on  populations  in  terms  of  losses  of  life.  Whilst  the  global  risk  of  violent  death  in  armed  conflict  is  generally  lower  than  the  global  risk  of  homicidal  violence,  in  affected  countries  armed  conflict  destroys  lives  and  exerts  substantial  human  costs,  particularly  in  protracted  internal  conflict  situations.    From  United  Nations  Mine  Action  Service:  The  presence  of  mines/ERW  in  conflict  and  post-conflict  contexts  is  devastating  for  people  and  communities.  These  hazards  cause  grievous  injury  and  death,  impede  peace  operations,  and  hamper  post-conflict  reconstruction  and  development  efforts.  Findings  from  the  M&E  Mechanism  for  the  UN  Strategy  2013-2018  (UN  M&E  Mechanism)  illustrate  the  deadly  risk  posed  by  mines/ERW  in  affected  countries  and  territories  in  which  the  UN  operates;  in  particular,  the  disproportionate  impact  of  explosive  hazards  on  the  civilians  who  constitute  more  than  half  of  the  casualties  from  mines/ERW.  The  regular  monitoring  of  mine/ERW  casualty  data  through  the  global  mechanism  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  will  significantly  enhance  the  capacity  of  affected  countries  and  territories  including  Member  States,  UN  entities,  and  civil  society  to  understand  the  scope  of  these  threats  and  effectively  mitigate  the  harms  they  cause.'
