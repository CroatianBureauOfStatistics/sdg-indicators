rationale_interpretation: 'SDG  proposed  target  calls  for  reducing  water  pollution,  minimizing  release  of  hazardous  chemical  and  increasing  treatment  and  reuse.  Household  wastewater  includes  faecal  waste  from  onsite  facilities  (such  as  emptying  and  cleaning  of  cesspools  and  septic  tanks,  sinks  and  pits)  as  well  as  off-site  wastewater  treatment  plants  according  to  the  ISIC  definition  3700  for  "Sewerage".  Inclusion  of  onsite  facilities  is  critical  from  a  public  health,  environment  and  equity  perspective  since  approximately  two  thirds  people  globally  use  on-site  facilities.    Industrial  wastewater  (which  includes  point  source  agricultural  discharges)  responds  to  minimizing  release  of  hazardous  chemicals.  Diffuse  agricultural  pollution  is  a  major  source  of  water  pollution  but  cannot  be  monitored  at  source  and  therefore  its  impact  on  ambient  water  quality  will  be  monitored  under  6.3.2.'
target: 'Do 2030. poboljšati kvalitetu vode smanjenjem onecišcenja, uklanjanjem otpada i smanjivanjem otpuštanja opasnih kemikalija i materijala, prepolovljavanjem udjela netretirane otpadne vode i znacajno povecavati recikliranje i sigurnu ponovnu upotrebu na glo'
indicator_definition: 'Udio otpadnih voda proizvedenih u kucanstvu (kanalizacija i mulj), kao i gospodarskih djelatnosti (temeljenih na ISIC kategorijama) sigurno tretiranih odnosu na ukupnu otpadnu vodu koja nastaje u kucanstvima i gospodarskim djelatnostima. Iako definicija '
method_of_computation: 'The  wastewater  safely  treated  is  calculated  by  combining  the  percentage  of  household  (sewage  and  faecal  sludge)  wastewater  and  the  percentage  of  wastewater  from  hazardous  industries  treated.  Household  surveys  and  censuses  provide  information  on  use  of  types  of  basic  sanitation  facilities.  These  estimates  are  combined  with  safety  factors  for  on-site  disposal  and  for  transportation  to  designated  places  for  safe  disposal  or  treatment,  as  described  in  indicator  6.2.1.  The  information  generated  for  indicator  6.2.1  will  be  combined  with  safety  factors  describing  the  proportion  of  wastewater  from  hazardous  industries  which  is  safely  treated  before  disposal  or  reuse  to  produce  indicator  6.3.1.  Calculation  of  safety  factors  for  household  wastewater  (sewage  and  faecal  sludge)  treatment  will  be  coordinated  with  estimation  of  similar  safety  factors  for  safe  management  of  sanitation  required  for  indicator  6.2.1.  The  accompanying  Statistical  Note  describes  in  more  detail  how  'safety  factors'  for  wastewater  treatment,  disposal  and  reuse  will  be  generated  through  a  national  assessment  process,  and  combined  with  data  on  use  of  different  types  of  sanitation  facilities,  as  recorded  in  the  current  JMP  database.  Statistical  methods  for  measurement  of  the  wastewater  treatment  (called  "wastewater  to  sewerage"by  SEEA-Water)  align  with  the  SEEA  definitions  and  treatment  categories  (primary,  secondary,  tertiary).  Statistical  methods  for  the  treatment  of  industrial  wastewater  align  with  the  SEEA  definitions  and  treatment  categories  using  ISIC  classifications  and  treated  volumes  from  permits  data.'
