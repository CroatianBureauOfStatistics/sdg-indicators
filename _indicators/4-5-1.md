indicator_definition:	"Parity  indices  require  no  additional  data  than  the  specific  disaggregations  of  interest.  They  are  simply  the  ratio  of  the  indicator  value  for  one  group  to  that  of  the  other.  Typically,  the  likely  more  disadvantaged  group  is  the  numerator.  A  value  of  exactly  1  indicates  parity  between  the  two  groups."
