rationale_interpretation: "Definitions  of  target  elements:  \n\tProtect  implies  a  reduction  or  eradication  in  loss  or  degradation  \n\tRestore  implies  a  reversal  of  loss  or  degradation  \n\tMountains,  Forests,  Wetlands,  Rivers,  Aquifers  and  Lakes  include  ecosystems  that  provide  freshwater-related  ecosystem  services  \n\tWetlands  are  further  defined  under  the  Ramsar  Convention  as  areas  of  marsh,  fen,  peatland  or  water,  whether  natural  or  artificial,  permanent  or  temporary,  with  water  that  is  static  or  flowing,  fresh,  brackish  or  salt,  including  areas  of  marine  water  the  depth  of  which  at  low  tide  does  not  exceed  six  metres.  It  may  also  include  subterranean  hydrological  systems.  \nWetlands  are  a  prominent  ecosystem  type  influencing  the  water  cycle  and  therefore  of  direct  importance  to  the  achievement  of  Goal  6.  Wetlands  loss  leads  to  increasing  water  insecurity  and  wetlands  restoration  (increasing  wetland  area)  is  now  a  widespread  response  to  achieving  sustainable  water.  Examples  include  how  wetlands  contribute  to  flood  regulation,  regulation  of  surface  water  flows  (flow  regulation),  and  nutrient  cycling  (pollution  regulation/water  quality)."
indicator_definition: 'Postotak promjene ekosustava vezanih uz vodu tijekom vremena (% promjena / godina). Indikator ce pratiti promjene tijekom vremena u opsegu mocvarnih staništa, šuma i sušnih podrucja, te u minimalnim tokovima rijeka, kolicinama slatke vode u jezerima i bra'

method_of_computation: 'It  is  proposed  to  estimate  percentage  change  in  each  major  ecosystem  present  in  a  country,  and  the  indicator  will  enable  Member  States  to  report  on  those  water-related  ecosystems  that  are  important  to  them.  Wetland  extent  is  computed  through  the  existing  Living  Planet  Index  methodology  for  data  collection  and  analysis  (http://www.livingplanetindex.org/home/index).  It  consists  of  a  number  of  stages  including  harvesting  of  time  series  data,  codification  and  database  entry,  aggregation  into  sub-indices  to  reduce  sampling  bias,  and  further  aggregation  to  create  subglobal  (ecologically  and  regionally  specific)  and  global  indices.  The  methodology  is  flexible  to  incorporating  improving  sources  of  information  and  data,  for  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of  trends.  The  structure  of  the  indicator  can  be  designed  to  align  with  the  SEEA  Water  accounts  and  estimate  percentage  change  in  Natural  Water  Capital  available  to  society  based  on  a)  Mean  Annual  Water  Availability;  b)  Mean  Annual  Water  Withdrawals;  c)  Environmental  Water  requirements  Aquastat  (FAO);  GEMS  Water  for  national  data  (UNEP).'
