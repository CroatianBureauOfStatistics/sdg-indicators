indicator_definition:	"This  indicator  is  defined  as  the  proportion  of  individuals  who  own  a  mobile  telephone,  by  sex.  An  individual  owns  a  mobile  cellular  phone  if  he/she  has  a  mobile  cellular  phone  device  with  at  least  one  active  SIM  card  for  personal  use.  Mobile  cellular  phones  supplied  by  employers  that  can  be  used  for  personal  reasons  (to  make  personal  calls,  access  the  Internet,  etc.)  are  included.  Individuals  who  have  only  active  SIM  card(s)  and  not  a  mobile  phone  device  are  excluded.  Individuals  who  have  a  mobile  phone  for  personal  use  that  is  not  registered  under  his/her  name  are  also  included.  An  active  SIM  card  is  a  SIM  card  that  has  been  used  in  the  last  three  months.  A  mobile  (cellular)  telephone  refers  to  a  portable  telephone  subscribing  to  a  public  mobile  telephone  service  using  cellular  technology,  which  provides  access  to  the  PSTN.  This  includes  analogue  and  digital  cellular  systems  and  technologies  such  as  IMT-2000  (3G)  and  IMT-Advanced.  Users  of  both  postpaid  subscriptions  and  prepaid  accounts  are  included.  Countries  can  collect  data  on  this  indicator  through  national  household  surveys."
