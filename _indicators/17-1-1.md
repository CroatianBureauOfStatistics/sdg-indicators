rationale_interpretation: 'The  headline  measure  presents  the  total  tax  revenues  received  by  the  national  government  during  the  year,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  '  i.e.,  total  national  income.  Taxes  include  personal  and  corporate  income  taxes,  taxes  on  property,  value  added  taxes,  excise  taxes,  tariffs,  customs  duties  and  social  security  contributions.

The  tax  to  GDP  ratio  supports  the  development  of  effective  tax  systems  and  is  an  essential  feature  of  a  successful  governance  framework.  Normalising  the  data,  by  dividing  total  revenues  by  GDP,  enables  easy  comparisons  across  countries  Comparable  and  consistent  tax  statistics,  such  as  the  tax  to  GDP  ratio,  facilitate  transparent  policy  dialogue  and  provide  policy  makers  with  an  important  tool  to  assess  alternative  fiscal  reforms  and  to  undertake  relevant  policy  actions.'
