  The percentage of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and
  technology at the household level. From non-solid fuels to clean fuels Current
  global data collection focuses on the primary fuel used for cooking,
  categorized as solid or non-solid fuels, where solid fuels are considered
  polluting and non-modern, while non-solid fuels are considered clean. This
  single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking
  fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for
  cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the
  home such as those used for lighting and heating. New evidence-based normative
  guidance from the WHO ( i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines:
  household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel
  and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines
  provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to
  what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home
  are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal
  and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the
  home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g.
  cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology
  combinations to ensure health benefits. For this reason, the technical
  recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in
  the home will be defined as "access to clean fuels and technologies" rather
  than "access to non-solid fuels." This shift will help ensure that health and
  other "nexus" benefits are better counted, and thus realized. Definition
  Percent of population with primary reliance on clean* fuels and technologies
  at the household level. *"Clean" is defined by the emission rate targets and
  specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene)
  included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality:
  household fuel combustion.
