  Prevalencija (iskorjenjivanje) umjerene ili teške nesigurnosti hrane u stanovništvu, temeljena na skali iskustava nesigurnosti hrane (FIES)
target: >-
  Do 2030. okončati glad i osigurati pristup svim ljudima, osobito siromašnima i ranjivijim skupinama, uključujući i novorođenčad, do  sigurne, kvalitetne i dovoljne hrane tijekom cijele godine
indicator_definition: >-
  To su zapravo dva povezana pokazatelja, koji predstavljaju postotak pojedinaca u nacionalnoj odrasloj populaciji (15 ili više godina) koji su imali umjerenu ili tešku razinu i teške razine nesigurnosti hrane tijekom prethodne godine. Stupanj sigurnosti nesigurnosti definira se kao mjera u kojoj ljudi imaju poteškoća u pristupu hrani odgovarajuće kvalitete i / ili količine zbog nedostatka novca ili drugih resursa. Teškoće uključuju i psihološke probleme povezane s borbom u pristupu hrani.

  The  FAO  Food  Insecurity  Experience  Scale-Survey  Module  and  US  Household  Food  Security  Survey  Module  questions  are  similar  and  both  rely  on  the  underlying  Rasch  measurement  model  to  determine  food  insecurity.  Where  FAO's  and  USDA's  measures  of  food  insecurity  differ  is  in  the  threshold  for  food  insecurity.  The  internationally  comparable  threshold  for  \  FAO's  measure  of  moderate  or  severe  food  insecurity  is  set  at  a  more  severe  level  of  food  insecurity  than  is  USDA's  threshold  for  U.S.  food  insecurity.  Thus,  the  prevelance  of  food  insecurity  as  measured  by  USDA  methods  is  not  perfectly  comparable  to  FAO's  prevalence  of  moderate  or  severe  food  insecurity.

  Food-insecure  households  had  difficulty  at  some  time  during  the  year  providing  enough  food  for  all  their  members  due  to  a  lack  of  resources.  USDA's  food  insecurity  statistics  are  similar  in  concept  to  those  obtained  with  FAO's  Food  Insecurity  Experience  Scale.  However,  the  threshold  for  food  insecurity  differs  between  the  two  data  sources.  FAO's  measure  of  moderate  or  severe  food  insecurity  is  somewhat  more  severe  than  USDA's  measure  of  food  insecurity.  Therefore,  the  prevalence  of  US  food  insecurity  as  measured  by  USDA  is  higher  than  the  prevalence  of  US  food  insecurity  as  measured  by  FAO's  Food  Insecurity  Experience  Scale.  FAO  measures  moderate  or  severe  food  insecurity  among  adults  while  USDA  measures  food  insecurity  among  US  households.

  USDA  food  security  statistics  are  obtained  from  data  collected  in  the  Food  Security  Supplement  to  the  Current  Population  Survey.  The  household  food  security  statistics  are  based  on  a  measure  of  food  security  calculated  from  responses  to  a  series  of  questions  about  conditions  and  behaviors  that  characterize  households  when  they  are  having  difficulty  meeting  basic  food  needs.  The  US  Household  Food  Security  Survey  Module  includes  three  questions  about  food  conditions  of  the  household  as  a  whole  and  seven  about  food  conditions  of  adults  in  the  household,  and,  if  there  are  children  in  the  household,  an  additional  eight  questions  about  their  food  conditions.  The  food  security  status  of  each  interviewed  household  is  determined  by  the  number  of  food-insecure  conditions  and  behaviors  the  household  reports.  Households  are  classified  as  food  secure  if  they  report  no  food-insecure  conditions  or  only  one  or  two  food-insecure  conditions.  They  are  classified  as  food  insecure  if  they  report  three  or  more  food-insecure  conditions.  Households  classified  as  food  insecure  were  "at  times  unable  to  acquire  adequate  food  for  one  or  more  household  members  because  they  had  insufficient  money  and  other  resources  for  food".
