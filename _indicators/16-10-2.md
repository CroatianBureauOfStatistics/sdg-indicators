indicator:	16.10.2
indicator_definition:	"For this indicator, the operative words are \existence\"" and \""implementation\"". As such, it establishes: (a) whether a country (or at the global level, the number of countries) has constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information; (b) the extent to which such national guarantees reflect 'international agreements' (e.g. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, etc.); and (c) the implementation mechanisms in place for such guarantees, including the following variables: \tGovernment efforts to publicly promote the right to information. \tCitizens' awareness of their legal right to information and their ability to utilise it effectively. \tThe capacity of public bodies to provide information upon request by the public. This indicator will thus collate data from multiple sources, including National Human Rights Institutions, national and international non-governmental organisations, academic institutions, and national media regulatory authorities, among others. Such information will be gathered, processed and checked by international organisations - UNESCO and World Bank. UNESCO collects some aspects of this data using the Media Development Indicators, in addition to the biennial World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development report. Data are available for at least 195 countries."""
