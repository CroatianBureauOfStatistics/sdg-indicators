  Pokazatelj označava opće poštivanje načela da se osobe koje čekaju na suđenje neće zadržavati u pritvoru. To počiva na aspektu prava da se osoba smatra nedužnom sve dok joj se ne dokaže krivnja. Iz perspektive razvoja, opsežna upotreba pritvora prije izricanja kazne, kada pritvor nije neophodan zbog razloga kao što su sprječavanje bijega, zaštita žrtava ili svjedoka ili sprječavanje počinjenja daljnjih delikata, može preusmjeriti resurse sustava kaznenog pravosuđa, ali i nametnuti financijski teret i teret nezaposlenosti optuženiku i njegovoj/njenoj obitelji. Izračun relativne mjere u kojoj se koristi pritvor prije izricanjazatvorske kazne može pružiti dokaze koji pomažu zemljama u smanjenju takvih tereta te osiguranju njihove proporcionalne uporabe.

indicator_definition: >-
  Ukupan broj osoba koje se nalaze u pritvoru koji još nisu osuđeni, kao postotak od ukupnog broja osoba koje se nalaze u pritvoru, na određeni datum. Osuđene osobe su osobe koje su podvrgnute kaznenom postupku koje su dobile odluku nadležnog tijela o njihovoj osudi ili oslobađanju. U svrhu pokazatelja, osobe one koje su dobile ne-konačnu odluku (na primjer, kada se na osuđujuću presudu može podnijeti žalba) smatraju se osuđenim.

  National  Prisoners  Statistics  (NPS)  -  Started  in  1926  under  a  mandate  from  Congress,  NPS  collects  annual  data  on  prisoners  at  yearend.  The  Bureau  of  Justice  Statistics  (BJS)  sponsors  the  survey,  and  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  serves  as  the  data  collection  agent.  The  NPS  distinguishes  between  inmates  in  custody  and  prisoners  under  jurisdiction.  To  have  custody  of  a  prisoner,  a  state  or  the  BOP  must  hold  that  inmate  in  one  of  its  facilities.  To  have  jurisdiction  over  a  prisoner,  the  state  or  BOP  must  have  legal  authority  over  that  prisoner,  regardless  of  where  the  prisoner  is  incarcerated  or  supervised.  The  NPS  jurisdiction  counts  include  persons  held  in  prisons,  penitentiaries,  correctional  facilities,  halfway  houses,  boot  camps,  farms,  training  or  treatment  centers,  and  hospitals.  Counts  also  include  prisoners  who  were  temporarily  absent  (less  than  30  days),  in  court,  or  on  work  release;  housed  in  privately  operated  facilities,  local  jails,  or  other  state  or  federal  facilities;  and  serving  concurrent  sentences  for  more  than  one  correctional  authority.  The  NPS  custody  counts  include  all  inmates  held  within  a  respondent’s  facilities,  including  inmates  housed  for  other  correctional  facilities.  The  custody  counts  exclude  inmates  held  in  local  jails  and  in  other  jurisdictions.  With  a  few  exceptions,  the  NPS  custody  counts  exclude  inmates  held  in  privately  operated  facilities.  Annual  Survey  of  Jails  (ASJ)  -  In  years  between  a  complete  census  of  local  jails,  the  Bureau  of  Justice  Statistics  (BJS)  conducts  the  Annual  Survey  of  Jails  (ASJ).  ASJ  uses  a  stratified  probability  sample  of  jail  jurisdictions  to  estimate  the  number  and  characteristics  of  local  inmates  nationwide.  In  the  sampling  design,  the  jail  jurisdictions  nationwide  are  grouped  into  10  strata.  In  2013-14  and  2015,  the  10  strata  were  defined  by  two  variables:  the  jail  jurisdiction  average  daily  population  (ADP),  and  whether  the  jurisdiction  held  at  least  one  juvenile.  For  8  of  the  10  strata,  a  random  sample  of  jail  jurisdictions  was  selected.  For  the  remaining  two  strata,  all  jurisdictions  were  included  in  the  sample.  One  stratum  consisted  of  all  jails  that  were  operated  jointly  by  two  or  more  jurisdictions  (referred  to  as  multi-jurisdictional  jails).  The  other  stratum  (referred  to  as  certainty  stratum)  consisted  of  all  jail  jurisdictions  that  held  juvenile  inmates  at  the  time  of  the  Census  of  Jail  Inmates  (2005  Census  for  ASJ  2013-14;  2013  Census  for  ASJ  2015)and  had  an  ADP  of  500  or  more  inmates  during  the  12  months  ending  June  30,  2005  (for  ASJ  2013-14)  or  ending  December  31,  2013  (for  ASJ  2015)  or  held  only  adult  inmates  and  had  an  ADP  of  750  or  more.  BJS  obtains  data  from  sampled  jail  jurisdictions  by  mailed  and  web-based  survey  questionnaires.  After  follow-up  phone  calls,  the  item  response  rate  for  jails  that  responded  to  the  survey  was  nearly  100%  for  critical  items.  BJS  implements  nonresponse  weight  adjustment  procedures  to  account  for  unit  nonresponse.  See  BJS  website  for  questionnaires  and  additional  metadata:  https://www.bjs.gov/.
