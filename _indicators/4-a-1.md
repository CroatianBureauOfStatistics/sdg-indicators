actual_indicator_available: 'Percentage  of  public  schools  with  Internet  access  for  student  use.  Estimated  percentage  of  public  schools  with  basic  drinking  water,  sanitation  facilities,  and  hand  washing  facilities.'
us_method_of_computation: 'NCES  is  estimating  the  percentages  of  public  schools  having  these  basic  facilities  at  100  percent.  There  was  a  survey  in  2008  that  found  that  98  percent  of  public  schools  had  computers  for  student  use.  We  believe  the  percentage  has  increased  since  that  date.'
comments_and_limitations: 'The  values  are  estimated,  but  we  are  quite  sure  that  the  actual  values  for  all  of  them  approach  100  percent.'

actual_indicator_available_description: 'The  National  Center  for  Education  Statistics  has  not  gathered  information  on  student  access  to  computers  at  school  since  1998  (98  percent).  We  are  not  aware  of  any  data  collection  NCES  has  had  of  the  number  or  percentage  of  schools  with  basic  sanitation  facilities.  There  was  a  physical  accommodations  survey  done  in  the  mid  1970s,  but  this  is  no  longer  at  all  relevant  because  it  was  done  so  long  ago  and  so  much  progress  has  been  made  both  with  respect  to  school  improvement  and  new  regulations.  We  believe  that  we  do  have  some  schools  without  single-sex  bathrooms,  primarily  because  they  only  have  a  very  small  number  of  students  or  only  serve  male  or  only  female  students.  Fundamentally,  this  block  of  indicators  is  not  policy-relevant  for  the  United  States.  Rather  than  reporting  missing,  we  are  reporting  100  percent  which  we  know  is  close  to  the  U.S.  value  and  reflects  the  relatively  high  quality  of  the  education  infrastructure  in  the  United  States.'
