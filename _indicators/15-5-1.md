rationale_interpretation: 'The  world's  species  are  impacted  by  a  number  of  threatening  processes,  including  habitat  destruction  and  degradation,  overexploitation,  invasive  alien  species,  human  disturbance,  pollution  and  climate  change.  This  indicator  can  be  used  to  assess  overall  changes  in  the  extinction  risk  of  groups  of  species  as  a  result  of  these  threats  and  the  extent  to  which  threats  are  being  mitigated.    The  IUCN  RLI  value  ranges  from  1  (all  species  are  categorized  as  'Least  Concern')  to  0  (all  species  are  categorized  as  'Extinct').  An  intermediate  value  indicates  how  far  the  set  of  species  has  moved  overall  towards  extinction.  Thus,  the  IUCN  RLI  allows  comparisons  between  sets  of  species  in  both  their  overall  level  of  extinction  risk  (i.e.,  how  threatened  they  are  on  average),  and  in  the  rate  at  which  this  risk  changes  over  time.  A  downward  trend  in  the  IUCN  RLI  over  time  means  that  the  expected  rate  of  future  species  extinctions  is  worsening  (i.e.,  the  rate  of  biodiversity  loss  is  increasing).  An  upward  trend  means  that  the  expected  rate  of  species  extinctions  is  abating  (i.e.,  the  rate  of  biodiversity  loss  is  decreasing),  and  a  horizontal  line  means  that  the  expected  rate  of  species  extinctions  is  remaining  the  same,  although  in  each  of  these  cases  it  does  not  mean  that  biodiversity  loss  has  stopped.  An  upward  IUCN  RLI  trend  would  indicate  that  the  SDG  Target  15.5  of  reducing  the  degradation  of  natural  habitats  and  protecting  threatened  species  is  on  track  towards  halting  the  loss  of  biodiversity  and  thus  preventing  the  extinction  of  threatened  species  by  2020.  An  IUCN  RLI  value  of  1  would  indicate  that  biodiversity  loss  has  been  halted.    The  name  "Red  List  Index"  should  not  be  taken  to  imply  that  the  indicator  is  produced  as  a  composite  indicator  of  a  number  of  disparate  metrics,  in  the  same  way  that,  e.g.,  the  Multidimensional  Poverty  Index  is  compiled.  Rather,  the  RLI  is  an  indicator  of  trends  in  species'  extinction  risk,  as  measured  using  the  IUCN  Red  List  Categories  and  Criteria,  and  is  compiled  from  data  on  changes  over  time  in  the  Red  List  Category  for  each  species,  excluding  any  changes  driven  by  improved  knowledge  or  revised  taxonomy.'

indicator_definition: 'Definicija Indeks Crvenog popisa je višenamjenski pokazatelj koji mjeri ukupnu promjenu rizika od izumiranja po skupinama vrsta. Temelji se na broju vrsta u svakoj kategoriji opasnosti od izumiranja na IUCN Crveni popis ugroženih vrsta. Ovaj se pokazatelj'
method_of_computation: "The  IUCN  RLI  is  calculated  at  a  point  in  time  by  first  multiplying  the  number  of  species  in  each  Red  List  Category  by  a  weight  (ranging  from  1  for  'Near  Threatened'  to  5  for  'Extinct'  and  'Extinct  in  the  Wild')  and  summing  these  values.  This  is  then  divided  by  a  maximum  threat  score  which  is  the  total  number  of  species  multiplied  by  the  weight  assigned  to  the  'Extinct'  category.  This  final  value  is  subtracted  from  1  to  give  the  IUCN  RLI  value.  see  report  for  mathematical  calculation  expression  The  formula  requires  that:  \tExactly  the  same  set  of  species  is  included  in  all  time  periods,  and  \tThe  only  Red  List  Category  changes  are  those  resulting  from  genuine  improvement  or  deterioration  in  status  (i.e.,  excluding  changes  resulting  from  improved  knowledge  or  taxonomic  revisions),  and  \tData  Deficient  species  be  excluded.  In  many  cases,  species  lists  will  change  slightly  from  one  assessment  to  the  next  (e.g.,  owing  to  taxonomic  revisions).  The  conditions  can  therefore  be  met  by  retrospectively  adjusting  earlier  Red  List  categorizations  using  current  information  and  taxonomy.  This  is  achieved  by  assuming  that  the  current  Red  List  Categories  for  the  taxa  have  applied  since  the  set  of  species  was  first  assessed  for  the  Red  List,  unless  there  is  information  to  the  contrary  that  genuine  status  changes  have  occurred.  Such  information  is  often  contextual  (e.g.,  relating  to  the  known  history  of  habitat  loss  within  the  range  of  the  species).  If  there  is  insufficient  information  available  for  a  newly  added  species,  it  is  not  incorporated  into  the  IUCN  RLI  until  it  is  assessed  for  a  second  time,  at  which  point  earlier  assessments  are  retrospectively  corrected  by  extrapolating  recent  trends  in  population,  range,  habitat  and  threats,  supported  by  additional  information.  To  avoid  spurious  results  from  biased  selection  of  species,  RLIs  are  typically  calculated  only  for  taxonomic  groups  in  which  all  species  worldwide  have  been  assessed  for  the  Red  List,  or  for  samples  of  species  that  have  been  systematically  or  randomly  selected."
