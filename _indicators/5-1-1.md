rationale_interpretation: 'Laws  and  justice  systems  shape  society  by  ensuring  accountability,  stopping  the  abuse  of  power  and  creating  norms  about  what  is  acceptable.  Removing  discriminatory  laws  and  putting  in  place  laws  and  policies  that  promote  gender  equality  is  a  prerequisite  to  ending  discrimination  against  women  and  girls.    Because  this  indicator  monitors  laws,  it  focuses  on  de-jure  equality  between  women  and  men  and  girls  and  boys  and  instances  where  legal  frameworks  promote  gender  equality  and  women's  empowerment.  This  is  not  to  say  that  de-facto  inequality  should  not  be  prioritized.  In  fact,  even  where  discrimination  is  explicitly  prohibited  by  law,  unequal  outcomes  between  women  and  men  and  boys  and  girls  can  be  the  result  of  discriminatory  practices  that  prevent  women  and  girls  from  enjoying  their  human  rights.    Most  of  the  indicators  proposed  to  monitor  the  targets  in  SDG5  and  the  genderrelated  indicators  to  monitor  the  targets  in  the  other  goals  focus  on  outcomes.  By  focusing  on  laws,  it  is  possible  to  juxtapose  the  different  areas  of  law  that  are  measured  under  5.1  (e.g.  laws  to  prevent  sexual  assault)  to  the  actual  'results'  (rates  of  sexual  violence  against  women  and  girls  as  measured  in  target  5.2).  Therefore,  the  proposed  focus  on  laws  and  policies  is  meant  to  complement  the  outcome  indicators  proposed  under  the  other  targets  in  Goal  5  and  the  gender-related  targets  in  other  goals.'
indicator_definition: 'Pokazatelj mjeri postoje li nacionalni zakoni za promicanje ravnopravnosti spolova i nediskriminacije žena i djevojaka. Podrucja zakona koja se prate kao dio ovog pokazatelja su orijentacijski, ali mogu ukljucivati: da li je zajamcena jednaka placa za rad'
