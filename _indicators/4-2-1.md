indicator_definition: "From  UNESCO:The  percentage  of  children  at  the  start  of  primary  school,  typically  age  6  years  in  many  countries,  who  demonstrate  age-appropriate  health,  learning  and  psychosocial  well-being  and  possess  the  necessary  competencies  and  knowledge  required  for  learning  in  the  early  primary  grades.  The  age  at  which  children  start  primary  school  varies  across  countries.  This  means  that  the  indicator  may  broadly  reflect  childrens  development  between  about  five  and  seven  years  of  age.From  UNICEF:  This  indicator  provides  the  proportion  of  children  under  the  age  of  five  who  are  developmentally  on  track  in  health,  learning  and  psychosocial  well-being.  It  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  number  of  children  under  the  age  of  five  who  are  developmentally  on  track  in  health,  learning  and  psychosocial  well-being  by  the  total  number  of  children  under  the  age  of  five  in  the  population."
