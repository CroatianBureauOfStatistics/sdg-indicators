rationale_interpretation: 'The  Internet  has  become  an  increasingly  important  tool  to  access  public  information,  which  is  a  relevant  means  to  protect  fundamental  freedoms.  The  number  of  Internet  users  has  increased  substantially  over  the  last  decade  and  access  to  the  Internet  has  changed  the  way  people  live,  communicate,  work  and  do  business.  Internet  uptake  is  a  key  indicator  tracked  by  policy  makers  and  others  to  measure  the  development  of  the  information  society  and  the  growth  of  Internet  content  '  including  user-generated  content  '  provides  access  to  increasing  amounts  of  information  and  services.    Despite  growth  in  networks,  services  and  applications,  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  access  and  use  is  still  far  from  equally  distributed,  and  many  people  cannot  yet  benefit  from  the  potential  of  the  Internet.  This  indicator  highlights  the  importance  of  Internet  use  as  a  development  enabler  and  helps  to  measure  the  digital  divide,  which,  if  not  properly  addressed,  will  aggravate  inequalities  in  all  development  domains.  Classificatory  variables  for  individuals  using  the  Internet  '  such  as  age,  sex,  education  level  or  labour  force  status  '  can  help  identify  digital  divides  in  individuals  using  the  Internet.  This  information  can  contribute  to  the  design  of  targeted  policies  to  overcome  those  divides.    The  proportion  of  individuals  using  the  Internet  is  an  established  indicator  and  also  one  of  the  three  ICT-related  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  indicators  (for  Target  8F).  It  is  part  of  the  Partnership  on  Measuring  ICT  for  Development's  Core  List  of  Indicators,  which  has  been  endorsed  by  the  UN  Statistical  Commission  (last  time  in  2014).  It  is  also  included  in  the  ITU  ICT  Development  Index,  and  thus  considered  a  key  metric  for  international  comparisons  of  ICT  developments.'
