indicator_name: Dio BDP-a koji se odnosi na turizam kao udio u ukupnom BDP-u i stopi rasta.
target: 'Do 2030. osmisliti i implementirati politike za promicanje održivog turizma koji bi otvarao nova radna mjesta i promicao lokalnu kulturu i proizvode.'
indicator_definition: 'Dio BDP-a koji se odnosi na turizam (TDGDP) se definira kao zbroj bruto dodane vrijednosti (po baznim cijenama) kojeg su proizvele sve industrije kao odgovor na unutarnju turisticku potrošnju plus iznos neto poreza na proizvode i uvoz ukljucen u vrijednos'

rationale_interpretation: 'Rationale    Target  8.9  has  several  dimensions  but  the  essence  of  the  target  seems  to  be  on  promoting  sustainable  tourism  [that  ...].  It  is  recognized  that  the  suggested  indicator  does  not  cater  to  all  dimensions  of  the  target,  but  finding  one  indicator  that  would  do  so  seems  unviable,  certainly  over  the  short-medium  term.    There  is  the  added  challenge  that  the  concept  "sustainable  tourism"  is  mainly  a  policy  construct  and  not  defined  nor  part  of  an  established  or  internationally  conceptual/statistical  framework  at  this  point.  Even  though  UNWTO  together  with  a  number  of  countries,  UNSD  and  OECD,  and  counting  on  the  support  of  the  UNCEEA  are  putting  put  in  motion  an  initiative  towards  developing  the  measurement  of  the  relationship  between  tourism  and  sustainability,  notably  through  linking  SEEA  and  TSA,  it  seems  that  the  production  of  internationally  comparable  data  on  (something  that  could  approximate  for)  "sustainable  tourism"  in  a  significant  number  of  countries  still  has  some  years  to  go.    For  the  meantime,  the  suggested  indicator  (in  its  two  parts,  on  tourism  related  GDP  and  jobs)  seems  to  be  a  sensible  approximation  because  (a)  it  is  a  good  conceptual  fit  to  some  key  dimensions  of  the  target  (b)  it  stems  from  a  systems  approach  and  is  based  on  sound  internationally  agreed  methodology,  and  (c)  there  is  a  significant  number  of  countries  already  producing  data  for  this  indicator.  In  addition,  the  suggested  indicator  (tourism  related  GDP  and  jobs)  is  in  line  with  Goal  8's  general  focus  on  economic  growth  and  employment.    Finally,  the  TDGDP/GDP  part  of  this  indicator  can  complement  Target  14.7's  indicator:  "Fisheries  as  a  %  of  GDP"  in  order  to  cater  to  tourism  dimension  of  this  target.    Interpretation  Target  8.9  has  several  dimensions;  this  caters  to  the  dimension:  tourism;  promote  [...]  tourism.  The  value  of  the  economic  contribution  of  tourism  captured  by  this  indicator,  and  (relative)  increases  or  decreases  in  it,  could  indicate  the  degree  to  which  tourism  is  being  successfully  promoted.  This  indicator  is  useful  for  policy  on  tourism  at  national  level  and  the  level  of  sub-national  regions  as  it  gives  the  only  credible  measure  of  the  economic  contribution  of  tourism,  which  can  be  compared  to  GDP  contributions  of  other  economic  activities.  The  indicator  has  been  found  especially  useful  in  promoting  and  mainstreaming  tourism  in  policy  agendas  at  all  levels.  The  indicator  can  also  be  compared  across  countries,  although  true  international  comparability  of  the  figures  needs  to  be  improved.'
