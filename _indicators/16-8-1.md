  Representation  and  participation  of  developing  countries  in  international  organizations,  including  international  financial  institutions,  is  often  below  their  relative  weight  in  the  world.  This  indicator  would  measure  the  representativeness  of  developing  countries  in  international  organizations.    An  adjustment  could  be  made  to  compare  the  percentage  of  members  or  voting  rights  of  developing  countries  in  IFIs  to  their  share  in  global  population  (e.g.  for  governing  bodies  of  UN  funds  and  programmes)  or  GDP  (e.g.  for  the  IMF  and  World  Bank).  This  would  allow  compensation  for  the  fact  that  the  indicator  should  not  increase  until  reaching  100%.
