rationale_interpretation: 'Economic  growth  in  a  country  can  be  ascribed  either  to  increased  employment  or  to  more  production  on  average  by  those  who  are  employed.  The  latter  effect  can  be  described  through  statistics  on  labour  productivity  and  thereby  it  is  a  key  measure  of  economic  and  labour  market  performance.'

actual_indicator_available: Annual  growth  rate  of  business  sector  output  per  job
periodicity: 'Annual,  quarterly  available'
time_period: 1947-2016  available
unit_of_measure: Percent  change
comments_and_limitations: 'Business  sector  output  is  based  on  GDP,  but  includes  only  a  subset  of  the  goods  and  services  included  in  GDP.  The  business  sector  comprises  about  75  percent  of  GDP  since  it  must  exclude  those  portions  of  the  economy  for  which  productivity  measures  cannot  be  constructed.  General  government,  the  output  of  the  employees  of  nonprofit  institutions  and  private  households,  and  the  rental  value  of  owner-occupied  real  estate  are  excluded.'
actual_indicator_available_description: 'The  measure  describes  the  relationship  between  real  output  and  one  measure  of  labor  input  involved  in  its  production.  Measures  of  growth  in  output  per  job  show  the  changes  from  period  to  period  in  the  amount  of  goods  and  services  produced  per  job.  They  reflect  the  joint  effects  of  many  influences,  including  changes  in  technology;  capital  investment;  level  of  output;  utilization  of  capacity,  energy,  and  materials;  the  organization  of  production;  managerial  skill;  and  the  characteristics  and  effort  of  the  work  force.'
us_method_of_computation: 'Output  per  job  is  calculated  by  dividing  an  index  of  real  output  by  an  index  of  the  number  of  jobs  of  all  persons,  including  employees,  proprietors,  and  unpaid  family  workers.'
