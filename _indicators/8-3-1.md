indicator_definition:	"The  share  of  informal  employment  in  total  non-agriculture  employment  refers  to  employment  in  informal  jobs  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  total  non-agriculture  employment.  Informal  employment  comprises  persons  who  in  their  main  or  secondary  jobs  were:  (a)  Own-account  workers,  employers  and  members  of  producers  cooperatives  employed  in  their  own  informal  sector  enterprises.  The  informal  nature  of  their  jobs  follows  directly  from  the  characteristics  of  the  enterprise;  (b)  Own-account  workers  engaged  in  the  production  of  goods  exclusively  for  own  final  use  by  their  household  (e.g.  subsistence  farming  or  do-it-yourself  construction  of  own  dwellings),  if  covered;  (c)  Contributing  family  workers,  irrespective  of  whether  they  work  in  formal  or  informal  sector  enterprises.  The  informal  nature  of  their  jobs  is  due  to  the  fact  that  contributing  family  workers  usually  do  not  have  explicit,  written  contracts  of  employment,  and  that  usually  their  employment  is  not  subject  to  labour  legislation,  social  security  regulations,  collective  agreements,  etc.;  (e)  Employees  holding  informal  jobs,  whether  employed  by  formal  sector  enterprises,  informal  sector  enterprises,  or  as  paid  domestic  workers  by  households.  Employees  are  considered  to  have  informal  jobs  if  their  employment  relationship  is,  in  law  or  in  practice,  not  subject  to  national  labour  legislation,  income  taxation,  social  protection  or  entitlement  to  certain  employment  benefits  (paid  annual  or  sick  leave,  etc.)  for  reasons  such  as:  non-declaration  of  the  jobs  or  the  employees;  casual  jobs  or  jobs  of  a  limited  short  duration;  jobs  with  hours  of  work  or  wages  below  a  specified  threshold  (e.g.  for  social  security  contributions);  employment  by  unincorporated  enterprises  or  by  persons  in  households;  jobs  where  the  employees  place  of  work  is  outside  the  premises  of  the  employers  enterprise  (e.g.  outworkers  without  employment  contract);  or  jobs,  for  which  labour  regulations  are  not  applied,  not  enforced,  or  not  complied  with  for  any  other  reason.  Operational  criteria  used  by  countries  to  define  informal  jobs  of  employees  include  lack  of  coverage  by  social  security  system,  lack  of  entitlement  to  paid  annual  or  sick  leave,  or  lack  of  written  employment  contract."
