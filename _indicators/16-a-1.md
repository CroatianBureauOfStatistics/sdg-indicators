title: 'Existence  of  independent  national  human  rights  institutions  in  compliance  with  the  Paris  Principles'
permalink: /16-a-1/
rationale_interpretation: "This  indicator  measures  the  global  continual  efforts  of  countries  in  setting  up  independent  national  institutions,  through  international  cooperation,  to  promote  inclusive,  peaceful  and  accountable  societies.  The  creation  and  fosterage  of  a  NHRI  indicates  a  States  commitment  to  promote  and  protect  the  human  rights  provided  in  international  human  rights  instruments.  Compliance  with  the  Paris  Principles  vest  NHRIs  with  a  broad  mandate,  competence  and  power  to  investigate,  report  on  the  national  human  rights  situation,  and  publicise  human  rights  through  information  and  education.  While  NHRIs  are  essentially  state  funded,  they  are  to  maintain  independence  and  pluralism.  When  vested  with  a  quasi-judicial  competence,  NHRIs  handle  complaints  and  assist  victims  in  taking  their  cases  to  courts  making  them  an  essential  component  in  the  national  human  rights  protection  system.  These  fundamental  functions  that  NHRIs  play  and  their  increasing  participation  in  the  international  human  rights  fora  make  them  important  actors  in  the  improvement  of  the  human  rights  situation,  including  the  elimination  of  discriminatory  laws  and  the  promotion  and  enforcement  of  non-discriminatory  laws  \nAt  the  national  level  reporting,  the  better  the  accreditation  classification  of  the  NHRI  reflects  that  it  is  credible,  legitimate,  relevant  and  effective  in  promoting  human  rights  at  the  national  level."
