rationale_interpretation: 'From  UNODC:    This  indicator  is  widely  used  at  national  and  international  level  to  measure  the  most  extreme  form  of  violent  crime  and  it  also  provides  a  direct  indication  of  lack  of  security.  Security  from  violence  is  a  pre-requisite  for  individuals  to  enjoy  a  safe  and  active  life  and  for  societies  and  economies  to  develop  freely.  Intentional  homicides  occur  in  all  countries  of  the  world  and  this  indicator  has  a  global  applicability.  Monitoring  intentional  homicides  is  necessary  to  better  assess  their  causes,  drivers  and  consequences  and,  in  the  longer  term,  to  develop  effective  preventive  measures.    If  data  are  properly  disaggregated  (as  suggested  in  the  ICCS),  the  indicator  can  identify  the  different  type  of  violence  associated  with  homicide:  inter-personal  (including  partner  and  family-related  violence),  crime  (including  organized  crime  and  other  forms  of  criminal  activities)  and  political  (including  terrorism,  hate  crime).    The  interpretation  of  this  indicator  is  straightforward  also  for  non-specialised  users.    From  Goal  16  TST  Working  Group:  As  described  above,  this  composite  indicator  is  comprised  of  two  forms  of  violent  deaths.  Intentional  homicides  occur  in  all  countries  of  the  world  and  have  global  applicability,  while  conflict-related  deaths  occur  in  countries  with  ongoing  conflicts/wars.  Peace  is  a  much  broader  concept  than  violent  deaths,  however,  it  is  difficult  to  measure  many  aspects  of  peace  (threats  and  the  fear  of  violence,  insecurity,  and  other  forms  of  violence,  including  damages  to  persons  and  property).  Deaths  due  to  violence  are  universally  and  easily  understood,  are  frequently  monitored  and  are  comparable  with  only  minor  discrepancies  in  interpretation,  largely  due  to  the  finality  of  death.  Monitoring  intentional  homicides  is  necessary  to  better  assess  their  causes  and  consequences  and,  in  the  longer  term,  to  develop  effective  prevention  measures.  It  is  based  on  statistical  data  routinely  produced  by  law  enforcement  authorities  and/or  public  health  institutions,  with  a  high  degree  of  international  comparability.  Conflict-related  deaths  measure  the  direct  impact  of  conflicts  on  populations  in  terms  of  losses  of  life.'

us_method_of_computation: 'These  tables  contain  statistics  for  the  entire  United  States.  Because  not  all  law  enforcement  agencies  provide  data  for  complete  reporting  periods,  the  FBI  estimated  crime  numbers  in  these  presentations.  The  FBI  computes  estimates  for  participating  agencies  that  do  not  provide  12  months  of  complete  data.  For  agencies  supplying  3  to  11  months  of  data,  the  national  UCR  Program  estimates  for  the  missing  data  by  following  a  standard  estimation  procedure  using  the  data  provided  by  the  agency.  If  an  agency  has  supplied  less  than  3  months  of  data,  the  FBI  computes  estimates  by  using  the  known  crime  figures  of  similar  areas  within  a  state  and  assigning  the  same  proportion  of  crime  volumes  to  nonreporting  agencies.  The  estimation  process  considers  the  following:  population  size  covered  by  the  agency;  type  of  jurisdiction,  e.g.,  police  department  versus  sheriffâ€™s  office;  and  geographic  location.  Much  of  the  data  presented  in  the  Crime  in  the  United  States  publication  are  obtained  from  the  Monthly  Return  of  Offenses  Known  to  Police  form  which  is  required  to  participate  in  the  FBI  UCR  Program.  Data  sited  from  the  FBI  UCR  Programâ€™s  website  regarding  the  age  and  sex  of  a  victim  of  homicide  is  obtained  from  the  Supplementary  Homicide  Report  (SHR).  The  SHR  provides  additional  details  surrounding  the  homicide  such  as  victim  and  offender  age,  sex,  and  race,  type  of  weapon,  circumstance  during  a  homicide,  and  the  relationship  of  the  victim  to  the  offender.  The  SHR  is  not  required  for  participation  in  the  program.  Murder  victims  with  unknown  age  and/or  sex  are  not  included  in  this  table.  To  calculate  the  estimated  number  of  males,  females,  and  age  of  the  victim,  the  percent  distribution  was  figured  using  data  supplied  to  the  national  UCR  Program  on  the  SHR.  The  resulting  figure  was  then  applied  to  the  total  estimated  number  of  homicides  for  the  nation.  The  homicide  rate,  defined  as  the  number  of  offenses  per  100,000  population,  is  derived  by  first  dividing  the  nationâ€™s  population  by  100,000  and  then  dividing  the  number  of  offenses  by  the  resulting  figure.'
