rationale_interpretation: |-  From  UNODC  and  OHCHR:  Human  trafficking  for  different  forms  of  exploitation  represents  a  major  violation  of  victim's  human  rights,  dignity  and  inclusion  to  the  society.  It  has  an  impact  on  a  person's  health  and  opportunities,  it  creates  economic  inequalities  and  it  is  a  threat  to  the  personal  security.  The  regular  production  of  figures  on  this  indicator  will  allow  the  monitoring  of  the  impact  of  the  anti-trafficking  measures  to  the  level  of  trafficking  at  national,  regional  and  global  levels.  It  also  helps  to  assess  the  capacity  of  countries  to  detect  and  consequently  support  victims  of  trafficking.  It  will  raise  awareness  on  the  most  prevalent  forms  of  trafficking  in  persons  in  different  parts  of  the  world.    From  Goal  16  TST  Working  Group:  Trafficking  in  persons  is  a  universal  form  of  modern-day  slavery.  Trafficked  persons  are  often  victims  of  physical,  sexual  and  psychological  violence.  The  demand  for  cheap  labour  and  sexual  services,  coupled  with  criminal  practices  that  seek  to  profit  from  the  exploitation  of  vulnerable  people,  is  its  main  driver.  Addressing  this  most  egregious  violation  of  human  rights  would  significantly  contribute  to  one  of  the  main  priorities  of  post-2015  namely  to  "leave  no  one  behind"  and  has  its  legal  basis  in  the  UN  Convention  on  Transnational  Organized  Crime  and  the  optional  protocol  on  human  trafficking.

Column  heading  -  Commercial  sex  acts  -  provides  the  volume  of  human  trafficking  -  commercial  sex  acts  offenses  reported  to  the  FBI  UCR  Program.  Column  heading  -  Involuntary  servitude  -  provided  the  volume  of  human  trafficking  -  involuntary  servitude  offenses  reported  to  the  FBI  UCR  Program.  Column  heading  -  Number  of  Agencies  Reporting  Human  Trafficking  -  provided  the  number  of  agencies  reporting  human  trafficking  data  to  the  FBI  UCR  Program.  Column  heading  -  Estimated  Population  Covered  -  provided  the  estimated  population  covered  by  the  reporting  agencies.'
us_method_of_computation: 'The  FBI  began  collecting  these  data  in  2013  through  the  Uniform  Crime  Reporting  (UCR)  Programâ€™s  Summary  Reporting  System  and  National  Incident-Based  Reporting  System.  This  table  provides  the  volume  of  human  trafficking  offenses  as  reported,  the  number  of  reporting  agencies,  and  the  estimated  population  covered  by  the  reporting  agencies.  The  data  used  in  creating  this  table  were  from  all  law  enforcement  agencies  submitting  one  or  more  human  trafficking  incidents  for  at  least  1  month  of  the  calendar  year.  The  published  data,  therefore,  do  not  necessarily  represent  reports  from  each  participating  agency  for  all  12  months  of  the  calendar  year.  When  the  FBI  determines  that  an  agencyâ€™s  data  collection  methodology  does  not  comply  with  national  UCR  guidelines,  the  figure(s)  for  that  agencyâ€™s  offense(s)  will  not  be  included  in  the  table,  and  the  discrepancy  will  be  explained  in  a  footnote.'
