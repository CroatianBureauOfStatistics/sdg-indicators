indicator_name: Udio vodenih površina s dobrom kakvocom vode
target: 'Do 2030. poboljšati kvalitetu vode smanjenjem onecišcenja, uklanjanjem otpada i smanjivanjem otpuštanja opasnih kemikalija i materijala, prepolovljavanjem udjela netretirane otpadne vode i znacajno povecavati recikliranje i sigurnu ponovnu upotrebu na glo'

rationale_interpretation: 'The  proposed  indicator  informs  on  the  quality  of  water  bodies.  The  indicator  allows  for  evaluating  the  impact  of  human  development  on  ambient  water  quality  and  thus  enables  countries  to  assess  the  future  services  they  can  obtain  from  aquatic  ecosystems  (clean  water  for  drinking,  biodiversity,  water  for  food  production  etc.).  Water  quality  represents  the  actual  outcome  of  all  pollution  and  pollution  reduction  activities,  and  is  thus  essential  to  fully  describe  the  environmental  status  of  freshwater  systems,  as  well  as  to  fully  report  on  target  6.3.  Water  quality  also  feeds  into  all  other  water-related  targets,  and  the  proposed  indicator  can  be  used  to  directly  report  on  many  other  targets  or  parts  of  targets  (refer  to  supplementary  information).'
indicator_definition: 'Udio vodnih tijela (podrucja) u zemlji koja imaju dobru kvalitetu okolišne vode u odnosu na sve vodne površine u zemlji. Dobro oznacava kakvocu ambijentalne vode koja ne šteti funkciji ekosustava i ljudskom zdravlju prema osnovnim pokazateljima kakvoce ok'
method_of_computation: "The  GEMS/Water1  water  quality  index  approach  is  used  as  a  general  model  to  calculate  the  index,  in  which  measured  determinand  values  are  compared  to  guideline  values  (proximity  to  target  approach):  \t1.  Proximity-to-target  (PTT)  scores  for  each  determinand  at  single  monitoring  sites  are  calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  temporal  average  (for  the  accounting  period)  of  the  determinand  concentration  and  the  target  divided  by  the  range  between  the  (winsorized)  minimum  or  maximum  of  the  measured  determinand  concentration  (for  exceedance  and  non-exceedance  targets,  respectively)  and  the  target.  The  PTT  scores  are  scaled  to  the  range  between  0  and  100,  where  100  indicates  that  the  target  is  met  and  decreasing  scores  indicate  an  increasing  distance  from  the  target.  \t2.  The  water  quality  index  (WQI)  at  site  level  is  computed  as  the  arithmetic  mean  of  the  site-level  PTT  scores  for  the  selected  determinands.  The  WQI  scale  can  be  divided  into  different  water  quality  categories,  ranging  from  very  bad  to  excellent.  The  thresholds  for  these  categories  are  country  specific  and  should  be  reported  in  the  monitoring  system  by  the  individual  countries  \t3.  For  the  spatial  aggregation  at  the  basin  level  and  country  level,  the  water  bodies  are  divided  into  stretches  of  homogenous  quality  (between  consecutive  monitoring  stations).  \t4.  The  final  indicator  is  calculated  from  the  proportion  of  the  stretches  with  good  quality  compared  to  all  water  bodies  assessed."
