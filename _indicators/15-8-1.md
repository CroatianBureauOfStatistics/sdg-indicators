rationale_interpretation: "The  projection  of  the  current  trend  of  adoption  of  national  policies  on  invasive  alien  species  projects  a  nonsignificant  increase  by  2020,  with  a  slowing  of  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  proportion  of  countries  adopting  such  legislation.  The  adoption  of  national  and  international  policies  on  invasive  alien  species  may  be  a  first  step  to  combatting  the  spread  of  invasive  alien  species.  \nStrengths  \n\tThis  indicator  covers  191  countries  worldwide.  Caveats  \n\tThe  adoption  of  legislation  does  not  necessarily  indicate  the  existence  of  regulations  or  policy  to  implement  the  legislation  or  how  successful  such  implementation  has  been  on  the  ground  There  still  remains  a  need  for  further  indicator  development  to  make  this  link  clearer.  \n\tLegislation  does  not  necessarily  capture  all  efforts  against  invasive  alien  species  that  are  happening  at  the  national  level.  \nCurrent  storyline  \n55%  of  countries  that  are  Party  to  the  CBD  have  overarching  national  legislation  to  prevent,  control  and/or  limit  the  spread  and  impact  of  invasive  alien  species.  \n\n  see  report  for  related  information  \n  Adoption  of  national  legislation  relevant  to  the  prevention  or  control  of  invasive  alien  species.  Source:  McGeoch  et  al.  (2010)  Global  indicators  of  alien  species  invasion:  threats,  biodiversity  impacts  and  responses.  Diversity  and  Distributions,  16,  95-108.  \nThis  indicator  measures  the  adoption  of  national  legislation  relevant  to  the  prevention  or  control  of  invasive  alien  species.  The  global  trend  in  policy  response  has  been  positive  for  the  few  last  decades  and,  since  the  publication  of  GBO3,  the  adoption  of  policies  against  invasive  alien  species  has  significantly  increased.  \nAs  reported  in  2010,  55%  of  the  countries  signatories  to  the  CBD  have  enacted  invasive  alien  species  relevant  national  legislation,  and  most  CBD  parties  were  signatory  to  at  least  one  of  ten  other  multilateral  agreements  that  cover  IAS  in  some  form.  Among  these  countries  8%  are  signatory  to  all  10  international  agreements  (McGeoch  et  al.  2010).  For  example,  the  Council  of  Europe  has  been  developing  and  adopting  codes  of  conduct  addressing  some  key  pathways  (e.g.  horticulture,  botanic  gardens,  zoos,  hunting,  or  fishing)  of  invasive  alien  species.  Moreover,  once  the  European  regulation  on  invasive  alien  species  is  fully  adopted,  it  will  have  major  implications  for  neighbouring  countries,  but  also  at  a  world  scale,  as  the  European  institution  is  a  major  partner  for  global  trade.  \nProducing  this  indicator  nationally...  \nAll  countries  (191  in  2010)  party  to  the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  were  included  in  this  calculation.  Ten  multinational  environment  related  agreements  were  used  to  quantify  trends  in  the  adoption  of  IAS  related  policy.  National  legislation  related  to  the  prevention,  management  and  control  of  IAS  was  recorded  including  year  of  enactment,  type  of  legislation  (prevention,  management  etc.)  and  the  data  analysed  to  calculate  the  indicator.  \nUse  at  the  national  level...  \nAs  reported  in  2010,  55%  of  the  countries  signatories  to  the  CBD  have  enacted  invasive  alien  species  relevant  national  legislation,  and  most  CBD  parties  were  signatory  to  at  least  one  of  ten  other  multilateral  agreements  that  cover  IAS  in  some  form.  Among  these  countries  8%  are  signatory  to  all  10  international  agreements  (McGeoch  et  al.  2010).  For  example,  the  Council  of  Europe  has  been  developing  and  adopting  codes  of  conduct  addressing  some  key  pathways  (e.g.  horticulture,  botanic  gardens,  zoos,  hunting,  or  fishing)  of  invasive  alien  species.  Moreover,  once  the  European  regulation  on  invasive  alien  species  is  fully  adopted,  it  will  have  major  implications  for  neighbouring  countries,  but  also  on  a  global  scale,  as  the  European  institution  is  a  major  partner  for  global  trade.  \nFuture  developments...  \nThis  indicator  was  first  calculated  in  2010  and  there  has  been  no  update  since.  Plans  are  to  update  this  baseline,  enhance  it  and  make  it  available  for  global,  regional  and  national  use."

method_of_computation: 'Data  for  this  indicator  were  produced  as  follows:  any  national  legislation  relevant  to  controlling  invasive  alien  species  was  identified  for  each  of  the  191  Parties  to  the  CBD.  Legislation  was  considered  relevant  to  the  prevention  of  alien  species  introductions  or  to  control  of  invasive  alien  species  if  it  applied  to  multiple  taxonomic  groups  and  was  not  exclusively  intended  to  protect  agriculture.  If  two  separate  sets  of  legislation  within  a  country  covered  plants  and  animals,  the  date  of  the  more  recent  legislation  was  used.'
