rationale_interpretation: "From  UNICEF:  \nFGM/C  is  a  violation  of  girls'  and  women's  human  rights.  There  is  also  a  large  body  of  literature  documenting  the  adverse  health  consequences  of  FGM/C  over  both  the  short  and  long  term.  FGM/C  is  condemned  by  a  number  of  international  treaties  and  conventions  including  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Right  (Article  25).  FGM/C  can  also  be  considered  as  a  form  of  violence  against  women,  and  therefore  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  against  Women  can  be  invoked.  Similarly,  defining  it  as  a  form  of  torture  brings  it  under  the  rubric  of  the  Convention  against  Torture  and  Other  Cruel,  Inhuman,  or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment.  Moreover,  since  FGM/C  is  regarded  as  a  traditional  practice  prejudicial  to  the  health  of  children  and  is,  in  most  cases,  performed  on  minors,  it  violates  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child.  Existing  national  legislation  in  many  countries  also  include  explicit  bans  against  FGM/C.  \n\nFrom  WHO:  \n  Female  genital  mutilation  (FGM)  comprises  all  procedures  that  involve  the  partial  or  total  removal  of  external  genitalia  or  other  injury  to  the  female  genital  organs  for  non-medical  reasons  [1].  Although  it  is  internationally  recognized  as  a  violation  of  human  rights  (including:  the  right  to  non-discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  sex;  the  right  to  life;  the  right  to  the  highest  attainable  standard  of  health;  the  right  to  freedom  From  torture  or  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment;  and  the  rights  of  the  child),  and  legislation  to  prohibit  the  procedure  has  been  put  in  place  in  many  countries,  the  practice  has  still  been  documented.  \nWHO  classifies  FGM  into  four  types:  [1]  \n\tType  I:  Partial  or  total  removal  of  the  clitoris  and/or  the  prepuce  (clitoridectomy).  \n\tType  II:  Partial  or  total  removal  of  the  clitoris  and  the  labia  minora,  with  or  without  excision  of  the  labia  majora  (excision).  \n\tType  III:  Narrowing  of  the  vaginal  orifice  with  the  creation  of  a  covering  seal  by  cutting  and  appositioning  the  labia  minora  and/or  the  labia  majora,  with  or  without  excision  of  the  clitoris  (infibulation).  \n\tType  IV:  All  other  harmful  procedures  to  the  female  genitalia  for  non-medical  purposes,  for  example:  pricking,  pulling,  piercing,  incising,  scraping  and  cauterization.  \nThe  removal  of  or  damage  to  healthy,  normal  genital  tissue  interferes  with  the  natural  functioning  of  the  body  and  causes  several  immediate  and  long-term  health  consequences."
