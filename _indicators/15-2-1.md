rationale_interpretation: "The  definition  of  SFM  by  UN  GA  contains  several  key  aspects,  notably  that  sustainable  forest  management  is  a  concept  which  varies  over  time  and  between  countries,  whose  circumstances  '  ecological,  social  and  economic  '  vary  widely,  but  that  it  should  always  address  a  wide  range  of  forest  values,  including  economic,  social  and  environmental  values,  and  take  intergenerational  equity  into  account.  \nClearly  a  simple  measure  of  change  in  forest  area,  while  essential,  and  used  for  target  15.1,  is  insufficient  to  monitor  sustainable  forest  management  as  a  whole.  The  index  proposed  combines  the  two  indicators  at  present  under  consideration  (\"forest  loss\"  and  \"area  certified\")  with  measures  of  use/degradation  (sub-indicator  2),  biodiversity  conservation  (sub-indicator  3)  to  give  a  more  rounded  picture  of  sustainable  forest  management.  Further  \"topical\"  sub-indicators  will  be  needed  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  assessment  of  SFM  aspects.  The  significance  of  the  four  sub-indicators  may  be  briefly  explained  as  follows:  \n\t1.  Trends  in  forest  area  are  crucial  for  monitoring  SFM:  clearly,  if  there  is  significant  uncontrolled  deforestation,  forest  management  is  not  sustainable.  The  indicator  focuses  on  change  as  there  is  no  ideal  share  of  forest  in  land  cover,  as  the  share  is  determined  by  history,  ecological  circumstances  and  competing  land  uses.  The  indicator  covers  the  net  effect  of  the  other  parts  of  Target  15.2:  \"halt  deforestation\"  and  \"substantially  increase  afforestation  and  reforestation\".  However  most  countries  have  reliable  data  on  the  components  of  this  overall  trend  (deforestation,  afforestation  and  reforestation),  for  which  separate  targets  can  be  specified,  if  so  desired.  This  component  incorporates  the  concept  of  \"net  permanent  forest  loss  \"  at  present  classified  \"green\"  and  is  also  used  for  Target  15.1  \n\t2.  Changes  in  the  stock  of  biomass  are  determined  by  the  balance  between  increase  in  volume  of  wood  biomass  (annual  increment)  and  decrease  (natural  losses  and  damage  by  fire  insects  etc.,  and  wood  harvest).  In  a  sustainably  managed  forest,  increment  is  more  than  losses,  so  that  the  biomass  stock  increases,  or  does  not  decrease,  and  carbon  is  sequestered  from  the  atmosphere.  With  very  few  exceptions,  a  decline  in  total  biomass  stocks,  even  if  the  forest  area  does  not  decrease,  implies  unsustainable  management  (and  possible  degradation).  As  the  wood/carbon  ratio  is  constant,  there  will  be  exactly  the  same  trends  for  carbon  stocks  as  for  wood  biomass.  Therefore  a  single  indicator  addresses  carbon  stocks  and  flows  and  trends  in  growing  stock  of  wood,  and  may  be  expressed  in  m3  of  wood  or  in  tons  of  carbon.  \n\t3.  Forest  areas  managed  for  the  conservation  of  biodiversity  are  a  proxy  for  trends  in  forest  biodiversity  and  a  clear  indication  of  political  will  to  incorporate  biodiversity  into  forest  management.  The  CBD  Aichi  Target  11  calls  for  each  country  to  conserve  at  least  17  per  cent  of  terrestrial  and  inland  water  areas,  so  this  may  be  taken  as  a  goal  for  this  element.  Work  is  in  hand  on  developing  a  number  of  indicators  of  forest  biodiversity,  which  may  be  useful  in  the  future.  \n\t4.  The  fourth  parameter  looks  at  the  area  within  a  country  where  a  key  tool  for  sustainable  forest  management  is  applied.  The  existence  of  a  \"forest  management  plan\"  is  a  necessary  tool  for  evidence  based,  long  term  management.  Those  areas  that  are  certified  by  third  party  schemes  as  being  sustainably  managed  work  on  the  basis  of  an  independently  verified  management  plan.  While  the  latter  fulfils  a  higher  standard,  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  there  are  very  significant  areas  of  sustainably  managed  forest  which  are  not  certified,  either  because  their  owners  have  chosen  not  to  seek  certification  (which  is  voluntary  and  market-based)  or  because  no  credible  (or  affordable)  certification  scheme  is  in  place  for  that  area.  The  latter  is  true  for  most  tropical  countries.  For  this  reason,  using  \"area  of  certified  forest\"  as  the  sole  indicator  could  give  a  misleading  impression."
