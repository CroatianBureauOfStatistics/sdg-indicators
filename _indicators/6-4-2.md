target: 'Do 2030. godine znatno povecati ucinkovitost korištenja vode u svim sektorima i osigurati održivo zahvacanje i opskrbu slatkom vodom kako bi se riješila nestašica vode i znatno smanjila broj ljudi koji pate od nedostatka vode.'

rationale_interpretation: 'The  purpose  of  this  indicator  is  to  show  the  degree  to  which  water  resources  are  being  exploited  to  meet  the  country's  water  demand.  It  measures  a  country's  pressure  on  its  water  resources  and  therefore  the  challenge  on  the  sustainability  of  its  water  use.  It  tracks  progress  in  regard  to  "withdrawals  and  supply  of  freshwater  to  address  water  scarcity",  i.e.  the  environmental  component  of  target  6.4.    The  indicator  shows  to  what  extent  water  resources  are  already  used,  and  signals  the  importance  of  effective  supply  and  demand  management  policies.  It  can  also  indicate  the  likelihood  of  increasing  competition  and  conflict  between  different  water  uses  and  users  in  a  situation  of  increasing  water  scarcity.  Increased  water  stress,  shown  by  an  increase  in  the  value  of  the  indicator,  has  potentially  negative  effects  on  the  sustainability  of  the  natural  resources  and  on  economic  development.  On  the  other  hand,  low  values  of  the  indicator  indicate  that  water  does  not  represent  a  particular  challenge  for  economic  development  and  sustainability.'

indicator_definition: 'Odnos izmedu ukupne slatke vode zahvacene od strane svih važnijih sektora i ukupnih obnovljivih slatkovodnih resursa, nakon što se uzmu u obzir zahtjevi okolišni zahtjevi za vodom. Glavni sektori, definirani standardima ISIC-a, mogu ukljucivati ??npr. Pol'
method_of_computation: 'The  indicator  is  computed  as  the  total  freshwater  withdrawn  (TWW)  divided  by  the  difference  between  the  total  renewable  freshwater  resources  (TRWR)  and  the  environmental  water  requirements  (Env.),  multiplied  by  100.  All  variables  are  expressed  in  km3/year  (10^9  m3/year).  Stress  (%)  =  (  TWW  /  TRWR  -  Env.  )  *  100  It  is  proposed  to  classify  the  level  of  water  stress  in  three  main  categories  (levels):  low,  high  and  very  high.  The  thresholds  for  the  indicator  could  be  country  specific,  to  reflect  differences  in  climate  and  national  water  management  objectives.  Alternatively,  uniform  thresholds  could  be  proposed  using  existing  literature  and  taking  into  account  environmental  water  requirements.'
