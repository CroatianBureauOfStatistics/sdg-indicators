Do 2020. godine učinkovito regulirati sakupljanje i završetak prekomjernog ribolova, ilegalne, neprijavljene i neregulirane ribolovne i destruktivne ribolovne prakse te provode znanstveno utemeljene planove gospodarenja radi vraćanja ribljih zaliha u naj

Indikator koji predlažemo jest "udio ribljih zaliha unutar biološki održivih razina", a ne ograničenja. Stoga se neznatno razlikuje od indikatora 7.4 koji je trenutno uključen u "Milenijski razvojni ciljevi". FAO-ov Odbor za ribarstvo zatražio je izmjene

actual_indicator_available: The  Fish  Stock  Sustainability  Index  (FSSI)
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  The  FSSI  measures  the  performance  of  the  most  important  federally-managed  stocks  that  represent  85%  of  total  U.S.  catch.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Stocks  are  at  the  sustainable  level  if  abundance  â‰¥  80%  of  the  abundance  at  the  maximum  sustainable  yield,  with  the  exception  of  rebuilding  stocks,  which  must  be  at  100%.  Percentage  of  stocks  at  sustainable  level  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  total  number  of  stocks  at  the  sustainable  level  by  the  total  number  of  FSSI  stocks  with  known  stock  status  /  abundance  levels.

  1)  The  global  metadata  indicates  that  fish  stocks  are  within  biologically  sustainable  levels  if  abundance  is  at  or  higher  than  the  level  that  can  produce  the  maximum  sustainable  yield  (MSY).  All  U.S.  federal  stocks  are  managed  to  achieve  the  sustainability  goals  of  the  Magnuson-Stevenson  Act,  including  requirements  to  end  overfishing  and  rebuild,  to  achieve  MSY.  In  2015,  91%  of  federally  managed  stocks  were  not  subject  to  overfishing  and  84%  were  not  overfished.  U.S.  Metadata  indicates  that  fish  stocks  are  within  biologically  sustainable  levels  if  abundance  is  at  or  higher  than  80%  for  non-rebuilding  stocks  (100%  for  rebuilding  stocks)  of  the  level  that  can  produce  maximum  sustainable  yield.  2)  The  Global  Metadata  reports  at  the  United  Nations  statistical  areas  by  species  or  species  groups,  while  U.S.  Metadata  reports  at  the  species  complex,  species,  or  stock  level  for  U.S.  managed  stocks  throughout  their  range.  Note:  US  data  are  not  available  for  years  prior  to  2005.
