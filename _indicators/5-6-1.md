indicator_definition:	"From  UN-WOMEN:  This  is  an  indicator  measuring  specific  decisions  by  women  (aged  15-49)  on  their  own  sexuality  and  reproduction.  Interviewees  will  have  to  provide  a  yes  answer  to  all  three  questions  in  order  to  count  as  a  woman  who  makes  her  own  sexual  and  reproductive  decisions.  The  first  question  looks  at  the  ability  to  say  no  to  sexual  intercourse  as  a  critical  condition  of  sexual  autonomy.  The  second  question  measures  the  womans  decision  concerning  using  or  not  using  contraception.  The  third  question  measures  the  womans  decision  about  reaching  sexual  and  reproductive  healthcare  for  her.  The  three  questions  are  as  follows:  \t1.  Whether  a  woman  can  say  no  to  her  husband/partner  if  she  does  not  want  to  have  sexual  intercourse  (DHS  q.  1054)  \t2.  Whether  using  contraception  or  not  using  contraception  has  been  mainly  the  womans  decision  (DHS  phase  7  q.  819  and  820)  \t3.  Whether  a  woman  can  make  a  decision  about  sexual  and  reproductive  healthcare  for  herself  (DHS  q.922  with  added  language)  From  UNFPA:  The  indicator  is  based  on  three  central  elements  measuring  the  empowerment  of  women  (married,  in  union  and  ever  sexually  active  women)  aged  15-49  to  make  the  following  decisions,  :  (a)  whether  they  are  able  to  reject  unwanted  sexual  relations;  (b)  using  or  not  using  contraception;  and  (c)  whether  they  can  access  sexual  and  reproductive  health  care  for  herself."
