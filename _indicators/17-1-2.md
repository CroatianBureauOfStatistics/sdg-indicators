  Measures  of  tax  burden  are  indicators  of  how  well  tax  policy  meets  one  of  its  primary  goals,  equitably  raising  the  revenues  needed  to  run  government.  Equity  has  two  aspects.  The  first,  vertical  equity,  concerns  the  way  taxes  are  distributed  among  taxpayers  with  different  abilities  to  pay.  The  second,  horizontal  equity,  concerns  the  way  taxes  are  distributed  among  taxpayers  with  the  same  ability  to  pay.  Tax  burden  measures  thus  answer  broad  economic  and  social  questions  about  the  effect  of  tax  policy  on  the  distribution  of  income  and  wealth.    The  distinction  regarding  national,  state  and/or  local  level  government  is  important.  For  the  purposes  of  monitoring  this  indicator,  the  central  budget  is  seen  as  the  focus  (even  if  some  of  tax  payments  go  to  other  jurisdictions).  When  decisions  about  resources  are  made,  the  budgetary  central  government  is  a  key  subsector  of  the  general  government  sector  of  the  economy.  The  general  government  sector  consists  of  resident  institutional  units  that  fulfill  the  functions  of  government  as  their  primary  activity.  In  all  countries,  there  is  an  institutional  unit  of  the  general  government  sector  particularly  important  in  terms  of  size  and  power,  in  particular  the  power  to  exercise  control  over  many  other  units  and  entities.  The  budgetary  central  government  is  often  a  single  unit  of  the  central  government  that  encompasses  the  fundamental  activities  of  the  national  executive,  legislative,  and  judiciary  powers.  This  component  of  general  government  is  usually  covered  by  the  main  (or  general)  budget.  The  budgetary  central  governments  revenue  and  expense  are  normally  regulated  and  controlled  by  a  ministry  of  finance,  or  its  functional  equivalent,  by  means  of  a  budget  approved  by  the  legislature.  Most  of  the  ministries,  departments,  agencies,  boards,  commissions,  judicial  authorities,  legislative  bodies,  and  other  entities  that  make  up  the  budgetary  central  government  are  not  separate  institutional  units.  This  is  because  they  generally  do  not  have  the  authority  to  own  assets,  incur  liabilities,  or  engage  in  transactions  in  their  own  right  (see  GFSM  2014  Chapter  2).    There  is  a  widespread  acceptance    in  the  Addis  Ababa  Action  Agenda  and  indeed  in  Agenda  2030    that  multiple  sources  of  finance  will  be  needed  to  meet  the  SDGs,  and  that  these  will  need  to  work  together  effectively.  This  includes  a  greater  role  for  domestic  resources  in  meeting  national  development  goals,  and  for  interventions  in  which  public  resources    including  ODA  -  strengthen  domestic  capacities  for  expanding  their  revenue  bases.  Indeed,  especially  in  developing  countries,  vertical  fiscal  gaps  will  potentially  widen  as  demands  increase  for  higher  public  spending    particularly  in  countries  where  there  is  significant  pressure  on  central  authorities  to  provide  quality  infrastructure  and  basic  services.  In  many  cases  the  execution  of  the  budgetary  central  governments  proposed  budget  is  constrained  by  poor  revenue  administration  and/or  a  lack  of  a  statistical  framework  for  monitoring  revenue  streams.  Given  unpredictable  and  fluctuating  levels  of  revenue  in  many  developing  countries,  improved  revenue  statistics  will  help  mitigate  any  possible  budget  shortfalls  and  support  the  sustainable  development  of  national  economies.

  Tax  burden:  Revenue  in  the  form  of  taxes  as  defined  under  government  finance  statistics  (GFS)  code  11  as  a  share  of  total  revenue.  In  GFS,  taxes  are  classified  into  six  major  categories:  (i)  taxes  on  income,  profits,  a
