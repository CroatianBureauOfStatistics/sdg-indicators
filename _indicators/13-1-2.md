  Strengthen  resilience  and  adaptive  capacity  to  climate-related  hazards  and  natural  disasters  in  all  countries.
indicator_definition: "Death:  The  number  of  people  who  died  during  the  disaster,  or  directly  after,  as  a  direct  result  of  the  hazardous  event  Missing:  The  number  of  people  whose  whereabouts  is  unknown  since  the  hazardous  event.  It  includes  pe"

  Summation  of  data  on  related  indicators  from  national  disaster  loss  databases.  Make  the  sum  a  relative  figure  by  using  global  population  data  (World  Bank  or  UN  Statistics  information).  Relativity  is  important  because  population  growth  (expected  to  be  9  billion  in  2050)  may  translate  into  increased  hazard  exposure  of  population.  The  Expert  Group  recommends  not  using  the  indicators  related  with  the  people  whose  houses  were  damaged/destroyed  in  the  computation.  UNISDR  and  IRDR  groups  recommend  using  them  as  they  can  be  estimated  from  widely  available  and  verifiable  data  and  reflect  vulnerability  and  livelihood  issues.  Data  on  housing  damage  and  destroyed  is  essential  for  economic  loss,  so  using  these  indicators  would  not  impose  additional  data  collection  burden.  Double-counting:  From  practical  perspective,  double  counting  of  affected  people  is  unavoidable  (for  example,  injured  and  relocated)  in  many  countries.  Minimum  double  counting  is  summing  "number  of  injured"  and  Number  of  people  whose  housings  were  damaged  or  destroyed.  Relocated  is  sub-set  of  number  of  people  whose  housings  were  destroyed.  The  data  can  be  disaggregated  by  hazard  type.  When  applied  to  proposed  target  13.1  and  15.3,  hydrological,  meteorological  and  climatological  and  indirectly  biological  disasters  are  monitored.

  Cities  around  the  world,  as  well  as  rural  populations,  witness  growing  disaster  risks.  Impacts  of  climate  change  on  sustainable  development  are  observed  through  both  slow-onset  events  (e.g.  sea  level  rise,  increasing  temperatures,  ocean  acidification,  glacial  retreat  and  related  impacts,  salinization,  land  and  forest  degradation,  loss  of  biodiversity  and  desertification)  and  extreme  weather  events.  Human  loss  can  be  measured  by  the  number  of  deaths,  missing,  injured  or  ill,  evacuated,  relocated,  people  whose  houses  were  damaged/destroyed  and  people  who  received  food  relief  aid  as  a  direct  result  of  the  hazardous  events.    Cities  are  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  areas  to  natural  disasters.  Unplanned  urban  development  (e.g.  informal  settlements,  overcrowding,  inadequate  infrastructures)  exacerbates  urban  vulnerability  to  climate  change  impacts  and  hydro-meteorological  and  geological  hazards.  Over  half  of  all  coastal  areas  are  urbanized  and  21  of  the  worlds  33  mega  cities  lie  in  coastal  flood  zones.  SIDS  and  coastal  regions  are  particularly  affected  by  sea  level  rise,  coastal  flooding  and  erosion,  and  extreme  events  (e.g.  tsunamis  and  storm  surges)  due  to  undermining  natural  protective  barriers,  low  levels  of  development  combined  with  rapid  population  growth  in  low  lying  coastal  areas  and  inadequate  capacity  to  adapt.  Poor  urban  populations  must  often  resort  to  unsustainable  coping  strategies  and  mechanisms.    Large  numbers  of  people  remain  perilously  close  to  falling  into  poverty,  experiencing  shocks  that  they  are  unable  to  cope  with.  For  the  poor,  a  shock  of  even  a  relatively  short  duration  can  have  long  term  consequences.  Several  dimensions  of  poverty  are  closely  related  to  environment,  which  is  often  affected  by  natural  disasters.  The  poverty  reduction  agenda  could  include  well-designed  social  protection  scheme  to  help  protecting  the  poor  against  sudden  shocks  and  the  development  of  capacities  to  better  predict  and  prepare  for  such  shocks.  Better  management  of  natural  resources  can  themselves  strengthen  the  resilience  of  the  poor,  by  both  reducing  the  likelihood  of  natural  hazardous  events  and  offering  resources  to  help  cope  with  them.    Biodiversity  provides  ecosystem  resilience  and  contributes  to  the  ability  to  respond  to  unpredictable  global  changes  and  natural  disasters.  Healthy  ecosystems  act  as  buffers  against  natural  hazards,  providing  valuable  yet  underutilized  approaches  for  climate  change  adaptation,  enhancing  natural  resilience  and  reducing  the  vulnerability  of  people,  for  example  to  floods  and  the  effects  of  land  degradation.  These  ecosystem  services  improve  the  sustainability  and  economic  efficiency  of  built  infrastructure,  and  are  critical  for  sustainable  and  resilient  urban  areas.    This  indicator  will  track  human-related  loss.  The  disaster  loss  data  (particularly  mortality)  are  significantly  influenced  by  large-scale  catastrophic  event,  which  represent  important  outliers.  UNISDR  recommends  countries  to  report  the  data  by  event,  so  complementary  analysis  can  be  done  by  both  including  and  excluding  such  catastrophic  events.    The  indicator  will  build  bridge  between  SDGs  and  the  Sendai  Framework  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  because  the  reduction  of  human  related  loss  is  included  in  the  Sendai  Framework  global  targets  and  will  also  be  monitored  under  the  Sendai  Framework  Monitoring  Mechanism.  (mainly  based  on  TST  Issue  Brief  2,  5,  20  and  23-26)
