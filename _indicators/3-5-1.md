rationale_interpretation: 'Strengthening  the  treatment  services  entails  providing  a  comprehensive  set  of  evidence  based  interventions  (that  have  been  laid  down  in  the  international  standards  and  guidelines)  that  are  available  and  accessible  to  all  population  groups  in  need  of  these  interventions  or  services.  The  indicator  will  inform  the  extent  to  which  a  range  of  evidence  based  interventions  for  treatment  of  substance  use  disorder  are  available  and  are  accessed  by  the  population  in  need  for  these  in  a  country,  regional  or  globally.  For  instance  currently  UNODC  estimates  that  globally  one  out  of  6  people  with  drug  use  disorders  have  access  to  or  provided  drug  treatment  services  (World  Drug  Report  2014).'

method_of_computation: 'Number  of  people  who  have  received  different  treatment  interventions  in  the  last  year  divided  by  the  actual  number  of  the  target  population  (people  with  substance  use  disorders  measured  as  the  total  number  of  problem  drug  users).The  target  will  be  assessed  through  aggregating  the  information  on  the  type  of  treatment  interventions  and  extent  of  coverage  of  these  for  the  population  in  need.'
