rationale_interpretation: 'From  Goal  16  TST  Working  Group:    In  order  that  decision-making  be  responsive,  inclusive,  participatory  and  representative,  it  is  important  to  ensure  diversity  in  representation  at  all  levels  of  State  institutions  (central,  regional  and  local).    Article  25(c)  ICCPR  provides  that  citizens  should  have  access,  on  general  terms  of  equality,  to  public  service  in  their  country.  General  Comment  25  of  the  Human  Rights  Committee  elaborates  that  access  to  public  service  should  be  based  on  equal  opportunity  and  general  principles  of  merit,  and  further  states  that  the  provision  of  secured  tenure  would  ensure  that  persons  holding  public  service  positions  are  free  from  political  interference  or  pressures.    Article  7(c)  of  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  against  Women  (CEDAW)  stipulates  that  States  should  take  all  appropriate  measures  to  eliminate  discrimination  against  women  in  the  political  and  public  life  of  the  country  and,  in  particular,  ensure  to  women,  on  equal  terms  with  men,  the  right  to  participate  in  the  formulation  of  government  policy  and  the  implementation  thereof  and  to  hold  public  office  and  perform  all  public  functions  at  all  levels  of  government.    From  OHCHR:  In  order  that  decision-making  be  responsive,  inclusive,  participatory  and  representative,  it  is  important  to  ensure  diversity  in  representation  at  all  levels  of  State  institutions  (central,  regional  and  local).

Article  7(c)  of  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  against  Women  (CEDAW)  stipulates  that  States  should  take  all  appropriate  measures  to  eliminate  discrimination  against  women  in  the  political  and  public  life  of  the  country  and,  in  particular,  ensure  to  women,  on  equal  terms  with  men,  the  right  to  participate  in  the  formulation  of  government  policy  and  the  implementation  thereof  and  to  hold  public  office  and  perform  all  public  functions  at  all  levels  of  government.    In  cases  where  a  group  is  very  under-represented  or  has  experienced  historical  discrimination,  temporary  special  measures  including  minimum  quotas  on  representation  may  be  introduced  to  redress  such  discrimination.  In  some  circumstances,  such  as  linguistic  minorities,  ensuring  access  to  public  services  for  the  group  may  require  over-representation  of  that  group  in  public  service  posts.'
