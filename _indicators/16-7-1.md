indicator:	16.7.1
indicator_definition:	"From  Goal  16  TST  Working  Group:This  indicator  focuses  on  the  representativeness  aspect  of  the  target,  but  the  presence  of  diversity  also  conduces  to  inclusivity  and  responsiveness  of  decision-making.  The  indicator  is  calculated  as  the  number  of  public  service  positions  held  by  members  of  the  target  group  divided  by  the  total  number  of  such  positions.  From  OHCHR:  Target  groups  should  be  identified  at  national  level  in  an  inclusive,  participatory  process,  with  the  direct  involvement  of  marginalised  and  minority  groups  themselves.  The  Committee  on  the  Elimination  of  Racial  Discrimination  (CERD)  has  made  clear  that  identification  as  a  member  of  a  particular  ethnic  group  shall,  if  no  justification  exists  to  the  contrary,  be  based  upon  self-identification  by  the  individual  concerned.  This  principle  also  applies  to  other  population  groups.  Target  groups  may  include  persons  with  disabilities,  ethnic  groups,  LGBTI  persons,  indigenous  peoples,  religious  minorities,  linguistic  minorities,  youth,  older  persons,  or  other  groups  under-represented  in  the  national  context.  The  indicator  is  calculated  as  the  number  of  public  service  positions  held  by  members  of  the  target  group  divided  by  the  total  number  of  such  positions."
