rationale_interpretation: 'From  ILO:    To  monitor  the  progress  against  the  target  8.7.  Indicator  is  straightforward  to  interpret,  as  it  gives  the  headcount  of  child  labourers  at  national,  regional  and  global  levels.    From  UNICEF:  Children  around  the  world  are  routinely  engaged  in  paid  and  unpaid  forms  of  work  that  are  not  harmful  to  them.  However,  children  are  considered  to  be  involved  in  child  labour  when  they  are  either  too  young  to  work  or  are  involved  in  activities  harmful  to  their  health  and  development.  Children's  involvement  in  hazardous  work  can  compromise  their  physical,  mental,  social  and  educational  development.  The  issue  of  child  labour  is  guided  by  three  main  international  conventions:  ILO  Convention  No.  138  concerning  minimum  age  for  admission  to  employment  and  Recommendation  No.  146  (1973);  ILO  Convention  No.  182  concerning  the  prohibition  and  immediate  action  for  the  elimination  of  the  worst  forms  of  child  labour  and  Recommendation  No.  190  (1999);  and  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  (Article  32),  including  its  Optional  Protocol  on  the  sale  of  children,  child  prostitution  and  child  pornography.  These  conventions  frame  the  concept  of  child  labour  and  form  the  basis  for  child  labour  legislation  enacted  by  countries  that  are  signatories.    As  per  the  2008  Resolution  concerning  Statistics  of  Child  Labour,  the  operation  definition  of  child  labour  is  based  on  number  of  hours  spent  working  and  working  conditions,  and  encompasses  both  engagement  in  economic  activities  as  well  as  household  chores.'
indicator_definition: "From  ILO:  The  term  child  labour  reflects  the  engagement  of  children  in  prohibited  work  and,  more  generally,  in  types  of  work  to  be  eliminated  as  socially  and  morally  undesirable  as  guided  by  national  legislation,  the  ILO"
