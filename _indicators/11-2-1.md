indicator_definition:	"The  indicator  is  suitable,  particularly  in  the  countries/cities  where  the  information  exists.  The  Target  is  too  broad  intending  to  measure  multiple  aspects  of  urban  mobility.  The  indicator  covers  three  critical  aspects  of  this  target:	 accessible  in  distance,  energy-efficient  and  the  expansion  of  public  transport.  \tUN-Habitat  position,  in  line  with  all  the  organizations  supporting  this  indicator,  is  that  necessary  adjustments  are  required  to  minimize  its  complexity  and  make  it  more  suitable  for  global  monitoring.  \tThe  indicator  can  be  measured  by  a  proxy,  which  is  the  proportion  of  the  population  that  has  a  public  transit  stop  within  0.5  km.  This  reduces  the  complexity  of  the  20  minutes  (which  is  very  variable  in  different  hours  of  the  day  or  days  of  the  week).  \tIn  case  there  is  no  spatial  information  on  the  population  location  and  density,  the  indicator  can  measure  the  proportion  of  the  surface  that  has  a  public  transit  stop.  \tAs  cities/countries  evolve  in  their  data  collection  systems,  the  indicator  could  be  harmonized  to  include  the  elements  indicated  by  the  EC  (street  network  and  frequency  of  the  transport)."
