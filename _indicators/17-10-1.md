indicator_definition:	"Worldwide  weighted  tariff-average  is  an  indicator  that  provides  the  value  of  custom  duties  levied  by  every  importing  country  from  all  their  trading  partners.  The  unit  of  measurement  will  be  in  %  terms.  All  calculations  are  based  on  official  data.  However,  in  order  to  include  all  tariffs  into  the  calculation,  some  rates  which  are  not  expressed  in  ad  valorem  form  (e.g.,  specific  duties)  are  converted  in  ad  valorem  equivalents  (i.e.  in  per  cent  of  the  import  value),  The  conversion  is  made  at  the  tariff  line  level  for  each  importer  by  using  the  unit  value  method.  Import  unit  values  are  calculated  from  import  values  and  quantities.  Only  a  limited  number  of  non-ad  valorem  tariff  rates  (i.e.  technical  duties)  cannot  be  provided  with  ad  valorem  equivalents  (AVE)  and  are  excluded  from  the  calculation.  This  methodology  also  allows  for  cross-country  comparisons."
