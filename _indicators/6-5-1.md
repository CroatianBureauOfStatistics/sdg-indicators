target: 'Do 2030. godine, provoditi integrirano upravljanje vodnim resursima na svim razinama, ukljucujuci i preko prekogranicne suradnje prema potrebi.'
indicator_name: Stupanj integriranog upravljanja vodnim resursima (0-100)
method_of_computation: 'National  surveys  are  structured  in  4  components:  policies,  institutions,  management  tools,  and  financing.  Within  each  component  there  are  questions  with  defined  response  options  giving  scores  of  0-  100.  Questions  scores  are  aggregated  to  the  component  level,  and  each  component  score  is  equally  weighted  to  give  an  aggregated  indicator  score  of  0-100.  The  method  builds  on  official  UN  IWRM  status  reporting,  from  2008  and  2012,  of  the  Johannesburg  Plan  of  Implementation  from  the  UN  World  Summit  for  Sustainable  Development  (1992).'
indicator_definition: 'Taj se pokazatelj odražava u mjeri u kojoj se provodi integrirano upravljanje vodnim resursima (IWRM). Uzima u obzir razlicite korisnike i uporabe vode s ciljem promicanja pozitivnih društvenih, gospodarskih i ekoloških utjecaja na svim razinama, ukljucuj'
rationale_interpretation: 'The  indicator  captures  the  degree  of  implementation  of  all  main  elements  of  IWRM.  It  supports  decision  making  at  the  country  level,  as  results  can  be  disaggregated  to  review  progress  on  different  aspects.  This  will  strengthen  stakeholder  participation,  transparency  and  accountability.  It  also  enables  countries  to  identify  barriers  to  progress  and  ways  in  which  they  can  be  addressed.  It  also  facilitates  coherence  between  the  various  targets  within  the  water  and  sanitation  goal  by  supporting  water  monitoring,  planning  and  evaluation,  as  well  as  associated  capacity  building  and  thus  the  achievement  of  the  overall  water  goal.'
us_method_of_computation: 'National  Agricultural  Statistics  Service:  Data  are  derived  from  the  Farm  and  Ranch  Irrigation  Survey  (FRIS)  sampled  from  the  Census  of  Agriculture  irrigation  data.  Farm  definition:  A  farm  is  any  place  from  which  $1,000  or  more  of  agricultural  products  were  produced  and  sold,  or  normally  would  have  been  sold,  during  the  census  or  survey  year.  Acre-feet  of  water:  An  acre-foot  of  water  is  the  quantity  of  water  required  to  cover  one  acre  to  a  depth  of  one  foot.  This  is  equivalent  to  43,560  cubic  feet  or  325,851  gallons.  Acres  irrigated:  Acres  or  area  irrigated  are  the  acres  of  agricultural  land  to  which  water  was  applied  by  any  artificial  or  controlled  means  such  as  sprinklers,  flooding,  furrows,  ditches,  gated  pipe,  hand  watered,  capillary  mats,  trough  irrigation,  ebb-and-flood  irrigation,  sub-irrigation,  and  spreader  dikes  including  pre-planted,  partial,  and  supplemental  irrigation.  Land  flooded  was  to  be  included  as  irrigated  only  if  the  water  was  diverted  to  agricultural  land  by  dams,  canals,  or  other  works.'
comments_and_limitations: 'All  Years:  Excluded  from  these  data  are  institutional,  research,  and  experimental  operations.  Data  are  strictly  for  water  used  for  irrigation  on  farm  land  only.  2008:  Data  does  not  include  non-horticultural  land  use  for  horticultural  operations.  The  U.S.  Geological  Survey  conducts  a  water  resource  census  every  five  years  which  includes  all  water  use  within  the  country  http://water.usgs.gov/watercensus/  there  is  also  a  water  use  website  http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/'
