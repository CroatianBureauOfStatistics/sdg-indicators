rationale_interpretation: 'Data  on  human  rights  violations  committed  against  journalist,  trade  unionists  and  human  rights  defenders  is  required  to  know  if  fundamental  freedoms,  including  the  right  to  freedom  of  opinion  and  expression,  which  includes  the  right  to  receive  information,  and  the  right  to  freedom  of  peaceful  assembly  and  of  association  are  protected  in  accordance  with  international  law.  The  State  is  obliged  to  respect  the  human  rights  of  all  persons  under  its  jurisdiction,  in  that  it  must  refrain  from  infringement  on  rights,  as  well  as  an  obligation  to  protect  individuals  against  acts  of  third  parties.  The  indicator  therefore  measures  all  such  cases,  but  where  the  killing,  disappearance,  detention,  assault  or  torture  is  perpetrated  by  an  agent  of  the  State  or  any  other  person  acting  under  government  authority  or  with  its  complicity,  tolerance  or  acquiescence,  or  where  the  State  fails  to  adequately  investigate,  punish  or  redress  an  offence  committed  by  a  third  party,  this  will  constitute  a  violation  of  human  rights.    Killing,  disappearance,  arbitrary  detention,  assault  and  torture  of  journalists,  trade  unionists  or  human  rights  defenders  may  have  a  chilling  effect  on  freedom  of  expression  and  other  fundamental  freedoms.  In  order  to  have  a  full  picture  of  the  extent  of  protection  of  fundamental  freedoms,  it  is  advisable  to  also  have  a  basket  of  indicators  at  national  level  including  on  access  to  information,  other  aspects  of  the  rights  to  freedom  of  opinion  and  expression  and  freedom  of  assembly  and  association,  notably  the  right  to  communicate  with  international  human  rights  mechanisms,  and  other  types  of  human  rights  violations  often  committed  against  journalists,  trade  unionists  and  human  rights  defenders,  which  may  include  intimidation,  harassment,  prosecution,  defamation,  and  restricting  mobility.'
