  Forest  area,  as  defined  and  measured  by  USDA  Forest  Service  Forest  Inventory  and  Analysis  Program,  as  a  proportion  of  total  U.S.  land  area  as  measured  by  U.S.  Census.  Both  measures  are  used  as  periodically  reported  to  UN  FAO  and  published  in  that  organization’s  Global  Forest  Resource  Assessment  (FAO  GFRA)

  Total  U.S.  Forest  Area,  as  defined  and  measured  by  USDA  Forest  Service  Forest  Inventory  and  Analysis  Program  and  reported  to  UN  FAO,  is  divided  by  Total  U.S.  Area  minus  Inland  Water  Bodies,  as  defined  and  measured  by  U.S.  Census  and  reported  to  UN  FAO:  [Total  U.S.  Forest  Area]  /  [(Total  U.S.  Area)  -  (Inland  Water  Bodies)].  Resulting  measures  are  converted  from  acres  to  hectares.

  Forest  area  measures  derived  from  inventory  activities  involve  a  complex  mix  of  definitions,  sampling  protocols  and  statistical  procedures.  General  information  on  the  USDA  Forest  Service’s  Forest  Inventory  and  Analysis  program  can  be  found  at:  http://www.fia.fs.fed.us/.  A  summary  description  of  definitions  and  sampling  protocols  can  be  found  at:  http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20371.  The  U.S.  forest  inventory  is  conducted  on  a  continuous  basis,  with  results  compiled  periodically,  notably  the  five  year  compilations  published  in  the  Resource  Planning  Act  Assessment  (RPA,  see:  http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/gtr/gtr_wo091.pdf),  which  are  then  submitted  to  UN  FAO.  The  most  recent  RPA  numbers  were  compiled  for  2012  and  submitted  to  UN  FAO  for  their  2015  GFRA  report.  The  next  set  of  RPA  numbers  will  be  compiled  for  2017  and  submitted  to  FAO  for  their  2020  GFRA  report.  Inventory  results  are  sometimes  subject  to  backward  revisions,  resulting  in  minor  changes  to  previous  period  forest  area  estimates  (for  this  reason,  current  submissions  for  SDG  15.1.1  do  not  exactly  match  past  submissions  for  Millennium  Development  Goal  7.1).  Total  Land  Area  and  Inland  Water  Bodies  are  reported  by  U.S.  Census  on  a  ten  year  basis,  the  most  recent  of  which  was  for  2010  and  submitted  to  UN  FAO  for  their  2015  GFRA  report.  These  numbers  have  not  changed  considerably  over  the  last  two  decades  (FAO  GFRA  reports  identical  total  land  areas  for  1990,  2000,  2005,  2010,  and  2015).
