method_of_computation: >-
  We  propose  using  the  'total  agricultural  population'  as  denominator  of  part  (a),  instead  of  the  total  population,  because  ownership  or  right-security  over  agricultural  land  is  obviously  relevant  only  for  the  people  whose  livelihood  rely  on  agriculture.  Part  (a)  (  People  with  ownership  or  secure  rights  over  agricultural  land  /  Total  agricultural  population  )  *  100  Part  (b)  (  Women  with  ownership  or  rights  over  agricultural  land  /  Total  owners  or  rights  bearers  over  agricultural  land  )  *  100
